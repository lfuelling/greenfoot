editor-crashed
It seems that Greenfoot crashed while writing this class
to disk last time. The source code may be missing or 
incomplete. There should be a backup of this class 
in the project folder. If this class seems damaged,
   1 - quit Greenfoot
   2 - backup your project folder (just in case)
   3 - look into the project folder for a backup of
       this java file. Rename it to the original
       file name (with a '.java' suffix)

Greenfoot was unable to create a virtual machine (VM) to execute scenarios.
Often this is caused by overly restrictive firewall settings.
Please see [ http://www.greenfoot.org/doc/firewall ] for more
