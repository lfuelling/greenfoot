Setting up the MinGW64 environment for building the Bluej launcher
------------------------------------------------------------------

MinGW is a GNU-like environment for Windows.  MinGW64 is a 64-bit version.
The launcher must be 64-bit because the JVM (including its DLLs) is 64-bit, 
and thus a 64-bit environment (and 64-bit Windows) is required to build the 
launcher.

Download and install the MinGW64 distribution from:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/

Beneath the files list are a list of quick links.  Download the version:

    GCC-8.1.0 x86_64-posix-seh
    
Direct link is currently:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-posix/seh/x86_64-8.1.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0.7z

Make sure build.properties has a line like this pointing to the mingw64 directory:

mingw_root=C:/mingw64/mingw64

(If you unzip MinGW64 to c:\mingw64, you want to point the variable to the mingw64
directory that is inside that, as above, or manually collapse the directories if
you prefer, to avoid the duplicated path.)
