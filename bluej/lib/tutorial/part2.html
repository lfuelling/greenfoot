<h2>Terminal</h2>

<p>The cat has some other methods which we can try.  Right-click on <a href="guicss:.object-wrapper">the cat1 object</a> again and select the <span class="menu">void listen()</span> method.  This will print a message on the terminal, which will appear.  Terminal is an old computing word, which refers to a place where you can print text output, and listen for text input.  You should see a message saying that the cat meowed at you.</p>

<p>Return to the main BlueJ window, right-click the cat1 object again, and this time choose the <span class="menu">void play()</span> method.  The terminal will appear again, asking you what you will get the cat to chase.  You will see that <a href="guicss:Terminal .terminal-input-field">the input field</a> is active.  Type in what you want, for example: <span class="entry">toy</span> (note that you don't need quotes in the terminal), and press enter.  You will then see a message saying that the cat chased the toy.</p>

<p>Minimise or close the terminal window, and return to the main BlueJ window.</p>
