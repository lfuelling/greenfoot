    /** 
     * Finds a cursor for this Y coordinate (in scene coordinates).  Essentially there are three cases:
     * 
     * 1. The point is before this block.  Because we scan down the blocks in order
     *    using this method, it should return the given prevCursor.
     *    
     * 2. The point is within this block.  This method should return the nearest
     *    cursor, e.g. the cursor before if the point is in the top half of the block
     *    and the cursor after if it is in the bottom half, or a similar appropriate heuristic.
     *    
     * 3. The point is after this block.  This method should still return the last cursor.
     *
     * @param sceneY The Y in scene coordinates at which to find the nearest cursor
     * @param prevCursor The cursor before this frame, or null
     * @param nextCursor The cursor after this frame, or null
     * @param exclude Cursors in this frame that are not a valid answer (e.g. because they are being dragged and we are looking for a drag target).
     * @param canDescend If true, can go into subframes to find a closest cursor.  If false, only look
     *                   at cursors at the top level.
