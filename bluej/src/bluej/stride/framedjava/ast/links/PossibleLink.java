 * A possible link is an item in a slot which could be a hyper link to:

 *  - a superclass method (subclass: {@link PossibleKnownMethodLink})
 *  - a type (subclass: {@link PossibleTypeLink})
 *  - a variable (subclass: {@link PossibleVarLink})
 *  
 *  It's created by the slots, where we know which things *could* be a link,
 *  but we don't know for sure (e.g. this looks like a variable, but it could
 *  be undeclared, or it could be a method missing parameters, or it could
 *  be somewhere that we don't currently detect, e.g. a protected field in
 *  a superclass).  So we create a PossibleLink object with the details,
 *  which will then be inspected in the editor and it will be confirmed or not.
