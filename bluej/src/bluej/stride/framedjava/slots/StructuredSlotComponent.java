 * An expression slot has a hierarchy of InfixStructured items, starting with
 * one at the top-level.  Each InfixStructured has a list of contained
 * StructuredSlotComponent items, with optional Operator items between each.
 * There are three types of StructuredSlotComponent:
 *  - BracketedStructured, which has brackets (round or square) around an
 *     InfixStructured item (recurse back to the beginning of this comment...)
 *  - StringLiteralExpression, which has inside it an StructuredSlotField
 *  - StructuredSlotField, which is a single text field with text content.
 *  
 *  This interface has all the operations which are common to all its subclasses.
