/**
 * A HeaderItem is anything which might appear in a FlowPane header in a Frame.  This is typically
 * a slot, or a label.
 *
 * Importantly, there is a one-to-many correspondence between HeaderItem and actual Node components to
 * display in the FlowPane (not one-to-one as you might expect).  This is because things like ExpressionSlot
 * are one HeaderItem, but are implemented using multiple nodes (which means that they can then wrap individually
 * in the FlowPane, rather than as one clump, for long expressions).
 *
 * Generally, HeaderItem is just used to get hold of the graphical nodes (via getComponents); anything more
 * complicated is usually related to slots, which can be accessed via the asEditable method.
