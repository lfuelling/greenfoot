How to compile extensions               (last update 23.10.2002, jckm)
-------------------------

 1. cd to directory extensions
 
 2. build
 
 3. The extensions will all build, and place their .jar files
    in the lib/extensions directory ready for distribution
    
 This is automatically done when an ant dist is done, but not for a
 standard ant.
